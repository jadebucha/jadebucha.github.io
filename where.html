<p>Portland is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Maine, with a population of 66,937 as of 2016. The Greater Portland area is home to over half a million people, more than one-third of Maine's total population. The Old Port district is frequented by tourists, while Portland Head Light is also a destination. The city seal depicts a phoenix rising from ashes, which is a reference to the recoveries from four devastating fires. Portland was named for the English Isle of Portland, and the city of Portland, Oregon, was in turn named after Portland, Maine.</p>
