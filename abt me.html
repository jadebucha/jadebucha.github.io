<p>You might be thinking to yourself, "Who is this dashing young man?"  Well, you've come to the right spot to learn more about him.  I was born and raised in Portland, Maine.  I went to Reiche Elementary School, King Middle School, and Deering High School.  Currently, I am attending the University of Maine at Orono.  My hobbies include reading and playing guitar.  The one thing I love is music.  If you want to know more about my musical tastes, visit the "Music" page.</p>
