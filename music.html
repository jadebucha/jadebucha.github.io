<h1>Music</h1>

<p>If there is one thing I would place above all else, it is music.  When I was younger, I didn't really listen to music.  It wasn't until middle school that I really started to get into music.  In my freshman year of high school, I got my first guitar, and ever since then, I've been obsessed. When senior year rolled around, I joined a band as a bass guitarist.  While we never made our own songs, it was a great way to express how we felt.</p>


<p>When it comes to listening to music, I enjoy just about every genre.  I like to say that I'm pretty open to anything musically.  My favorite artists include:</p>
<li>Frank Ocean</li>
<li>Kanye West</li>
<li>Paramore</li>
<li>The Weeknd</li>
<li>Post Malone</li>
<li>A$AP Rocky</li>
<li>Dua Lipa</li>

<p>I also love going to concerts.  I honestly don't know how many concerts I've been to, but I wish it were more.  Some of the concerts I've been to are:</p>
<li>Dua Lipa</li>
<li>Panic! at the Disco</li>
<li>Kanye West</li>
<li>Halsey</li>
<li>Paramore</li>
<li>Waka Flocka</li>
<li>Bastille</li>
